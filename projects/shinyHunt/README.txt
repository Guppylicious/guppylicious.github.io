Concept:
    A Shiny Pokémon is considered to be very rare as the odds of finding one are very low.
        In fact, the odds are so low, that you can play through the entire game, multiple times, without ever encountering one.
    The odds of finding a shiny Pokémon differs on the generation used and can also be enhanced with certain methods.

Menu:
    Go shiny hunting!
        This mode will take you on a hunt until a shiny is found, which means that it could take thousands of attempts or just 1 depending on how lucky you are.
    Averages Hunt
        This mode will shiny hunt for the denominator of the odds calculation chosen (e.g. for 1/8191 odds, it will run 8191 iterations of a shiny hunt).
        For every shiny hunt that has taken place, the number of attempts taken will be recorded and added to a total which will be averaged at the end.
        Unlike the single shiny hunt this will prove the rarity of a shiny Pokémon as the average will likely be a number around the odds that were chosen.
            The more the average attempts fluctuates from this odds, will determine how lucky or unlucky you were.
        The highest and lowest number of attempts taken will also be returned to show the vast difference in attempts.

Key words:
    Generation (Gen):
        As Pokémon has evolved over time with new games/series being released, the way to distinguish between these has been referred to as generations.
        When a new generation is released, with it comes new mechanics, new concepts, and more importantly, new Pokémon.
    Shiny:
        A Pokémon with an altered colour palette.

Odds of finding a shiny Pokémon:
    Generation 1 had no shiny Pokémon, so it's not possible to find them.
    Generation 2 - 5:
        From these generations shiny Pokémon were at their rarest, with the odds of encountering one being 1 in 8191, or a 0.00012% chance.
    Generation 6+:
        From generation 6 onwards the odds were doubled to 1 in 4096, or a 0.00024%.
