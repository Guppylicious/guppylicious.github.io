			  <img id="pokeBattle" src="img/pokeBattle.png" alt=""><br><br>
			  <p>The Pokémon Battle Simulation is a PHP script that will simulate Pokémon battles similar to those in the Pokémon games.</p>
			  <p>The aim of a Pokémon battle is to reduce all your opponents Pokémon HP to 0, while not allowing your Pokémon's HP to drop to 0.</p>
			  <p>The script works by asking the user to build a Pokémon team and then select the trainer they wish to battle. When the battle starts it will function as a normal Pokémon battle would within the games by asking the user to select the attack they wish to use which will then be used on the opposing Pokémon.</p>
			  <p>Because the script functions as a normal Pokémon battle, it will take into account the stats of each Pokémon and attack along with any type advantages to determine aspects such as damage and speed, so it is important to choose Pokémon that can easily defeat enemy Pokémon.</p>
			  <img id="pokeDex" src="img/pokeDex.png" alt=""><br><br>
			  <p>The script also offers a Pokédex feature to help the user learn about their favourite Pokémon.</p>

			  <p>The Pokémon Shiny Hunter is a script that will search for a shiny Pokémon until one is found. When a shiny Pokémon is found, some statistics around the odds of this happening will be returned.</p>
			  <p>A Shiny Pokémon is considered to be very rare as the odds of finding one are very low. In fact, the odds are so low, that you can play through the entire game, multiple times, without ever encountering one. The odds of finding a shiny Pokémon differs on the generation used and can also be enhanced with certain methods.</p>

			  <p>Shut the Box is a game where you have to roll 2 dice and flip down tiles totalling that value, for example, if you roll a 3 and 4, totalling 7, you can flip down a combination such as the 7 tile, the 5 and 2 tiles, the 3 and 4 tiles, etc. You continue this process until all the tiles are flipped down. If you roll a value that is impossible to totally flip down from the remaining tiles that are up, you lose.</p>

			  <p>These flights would be able to be viewed by users along with their relevant details, such as departing and arriving airport and countries. The user would also be able to click on the flight they liked the look of and would then be able to book seats within that flight. Booking a seat would mean that it would become unavailable for other users to book.</p>
			  <p>The system also contains a user login system along with many administrator features to add, delete and update records in the database to ensure that the records in the database are kept up to date and correct.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">Swift using Xcode</div>
              <p>Within one of my modules during my time at the University of Liverpool, I was tasked to make an app that was context aware and displayed locations and information of artworks around the campus using a map with annotations and the user’s location.</p>
			  <img id="artwork1" src="img/artwork1.jpg" alt="">
			  <img id="artwork2" src="img/artwork2.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
			  <p>Because many of the artworks were within the same buildings, a feature of the app was to group artworks that were in the same building on the map so that clicking on the annotation would display a list of artworks within the building.</p>
			  <img id="artwork3" src="img/artwork3.jpg" alt="">
			  <img id="artwork4" src="img/artwork4.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
			  <p>When a specific artwork was pressed, information about the artwork and a picture of the artwork were displayed for the user to view. This data would be stored into core data when the app was started and would then be retrieved when necessary to display to the user.</p>
			  <p>The artworks were also listed inside of a table that the user could scroll through as an alternative way to view the artworks. These entries in the table were ordered based on the distance the artworks were from the user which was calculated through the latitude and longitude values of each artwork and the user.</p>

			  <img id="submarine" src="img/submarine.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
              <p>This game plays by allowing the user to place a user controlled sub, an enemy sub, an obstacle and many fuel cells onto an empty board. Once the board is completed and start game is pressed, the game works through a turn based system where the objective is to collect as many fuel cells as possible while avoiding the enemy sub and not running out of fuel. Each fuel cell is equivalent to the number it represents and adds this total to the amount of fuel left and the score when taken. The enemy sub will also move around the board collecting cells and targeting the player. If the player is caught by the enemy, collects fewer points than the enemy or runs out of fuel, the game is lost.</p>

			  <img id="arkanoid" src="img/arkanoid.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
              <p>Using the jMonkey Engine which is designed to implement games using Java code, I created a simple copy of the Arkanoid (also known as Breakout) game. The game works by detecting collisions of the ball, with the player controlled board at the bottom, the walls and the pegs to determine the new trajectory of the ball and slowly increase the velocity of the ball as the game progresses. When a peg is hit, it will disappear and add to the users score, when all pegs have been hit then next round starts. The user is given 3 lives and will lose the game when all 3 lives are lost.</p>
